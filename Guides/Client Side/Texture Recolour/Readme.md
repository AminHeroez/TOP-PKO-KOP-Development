# How To recolour a texture and Add it as a new item

All textures can be found at TalesOfPirate\texture (its not that hard to find a texture -.-)

Character has the clothes and item has weapons

To see all textures you need "restore.exe" you need to put that in the root of the top folder and then double click it. (restore is in bottom of post)

KK you can edit textures what w/e program you want. even with paint if you like. but photoshop, fire works, gimp and etc are reccomeded. This Guide is for photo shop but it also can apply with Fireworks and Gimp if you have


MAJOR NOTE: SAVE THE ORIGINAL TEXTURE SOME WHERE ELSE. You may want to use it again /\ /\

How to recolour

Option one
1. Open up your texture
[Ill be using Brutal Chef for this guide]

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/5bd1ud.jpg)

2. Make the texture so its in separate layers
By this i mean divide up the picture and have them at different layers... well easier to show...

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/1dzkic.jpg)

To do this you need to use the tools "Marquee" or Magic Wand"

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/24gnhc7.jpg)

Marquee is the one on the left and selects with rectangles. Magic wand selects a certain colours so sometimes you need to hold "shift" to sleect all you want.

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/zupfmc.jpg)

once your done selecting, copy and paste. therre should be a new layer of what you selected. do this so you can get different layers like the picture from before.

2.5. Optional
You may save it as a psd file so you can make a new recolouring later

3.Colouring
Select the layer you want to recolour

Note: make sure the skin layer is always the first layer and if you texture has the Specific FF000FF Pink then make sure thats one of the top layers coz that pink is transperent in game. (note only the textures originally with that pink can be transparentable[if that makes sense] sp if the texture doesnt have that pink then you cant use the pink to make it transparent)

To colour I like to use Hue/Saturation (Ctrl+U shortcut in Photoshop)(Filters>Adjust Colour Menu in Fireworks)

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/jhq4qo.jpg)

Once you clicked it there should be a menu like this. Make sure colourize is ticked

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/29265wn.jpg)

And now you can colour. Hue is to change the colour. Saturation is like well you can see for yourself. and Lightness is obvous..

kk now you can colour it w/e you want. heres what i did

Option 2

ok spilt the image into 2 layers..
one with the skin... use marquee/magic wand tool for that and normal thingy..

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/149rvjk.png)

OK select the first layer.. not the skin layer
now go here under your layers and clock the circle with thats half black and grey

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/w19xyc.png)


Ok once your there a screen like this appear.. click the gradient

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/104n3pg.png)

Now another screen should appear like this...
![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/33p389k.png)

You can either change the colour or add more colours to the gradient..
eg.

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/2zhldhx.png)

test out and see what colours you like. this is a very efficient way and you wont have to cut lots of layers but its important that you must put the kin layer on top of the gradient layer and if there is a transparent pink layer.. put that on top aswell.

Heres what i came up with.

------------------------------------------------------


The Next step
Kk now with the texture you can replace the original texture and just keep it that way(you must save as Bitmap).
Heres steps in case

Clck save as... in photo shop

put it in: texture > character or item... depending

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/10ihu9x%20(1).png)

Now save it as a bmp.

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/18osqx.png)

Now since there is a texture of the same name it will automatically put the word copy in front of the texture name.. get rid of it

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/2a69p42.png)

Wolah.. time to test it /\ /\

------------------------------------------------------------------------


End products..

Option 1

Option 2

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/2irw51e.png)

Both ways are good. Just remember that gradient maps effect the whole thingy while hue and stauration can work for different pieces of the texture. You can combine both methods such as spilliting the layer into different parts and then use gradient maps. Its completely your choice.

Now you can make it as a new item by Hexing
the lgo file is the same number as the texture file

Hexing - credits to blade
Download Hex Editor: i use http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm

open .lgo of w/e apparel u modified in it

![alt text](https://github.com/AminHeroez/TOP-PKO-KOP-Development/blob/master/Guides/Client%20Side/Texture%20Recolour/wk0gv5.jpg)

Find xxxxxxxxx.bmp (red above - near top of file)
change it to number for your new texture
save
DONE



Or

open it with notepad

search for (ctrl+f) "Bmp" and change the number to ur texture number

wolah



then u add it to ur item info...
