This guide is about changing you're client name which would normally be: 
 

To your server's name. I hope you can understand the guide, which I made easy, and added all the pictures and stuff you need to know

~ First you will need this:
-Compiler

~ When you download the file, extract it.
 


~ When the extraction is finished, go into this location.
Bin Compile/Scripts/Table/StringSet.TxT and it should look like this -> 
 
[77]    "YOU'RE CLIENT NAME"

~ The stuff in cap locks, you should change it for you're server's name, Close the .TxT and save it.

~ Go back to the first part of the folder which is this one -> 
 


~ Click "Compile Bins" and then click "Ok"


~ Go back to Bin Compile/Scripts/Table/StringSet.Bin and open it as a notepad <- 
 

And it should look something like this <- 
 


~ After that you need to change you're client side, so go to you're Tales Of Pirates folder ( Or the one you're using to enter you're server.) Tales Of Pirates folder/Scripts/Tables which should be this one ->
 

~ Open it as notepad and goto the line 78 ( Ctrl + G ) <- 
 

~ After you find goto the line 78, replace it with the one you have in here Bin Compile/Scripts/Table/StringSet.Bin ->
 

~ Close and save, and it should look like this -> 
 


If you want your server players to have it, just make a patch containing the StringSet.Bin from you're Tales Of Pirates folder/Scripts/Tables.

Ok,changing the icon of the client it's not so hard but makes the client for private server more "personal"(and the ToP icon sux).

Now download an icon file(.ico) that you like or search for one in windows icons,change the name in "top.ico",replace the original in client folder.

So download Resource Hacker here.

Now open it and browse for game.exe file,select the icon like the screen,click "edit" and "replace resource",now click "open file with new icon".

Search for your icon(top.ico) and click ok. Replace the big and the small icon and you will have your client with your nice icon. =)

Hope it helped!
