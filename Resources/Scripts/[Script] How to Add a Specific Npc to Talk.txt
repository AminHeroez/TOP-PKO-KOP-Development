Welcome PKODEV VIP! Thanks for buying VIP, and downloading this awesome Release!
For the record, Walking NPC'S will be added in some weeks so stay tuned!
Okay, so what to do is, put install.lua inside modules folder, and TalkingNPC also.
to make specific npc's talk, use the NAME VARIABLE, so i'll make a example
IF you want a NPC to talk put the name of the npc Name == "NPCNAME" I added 2 examples at the script, 
1 with mob another with NPC. for mob, same thing put NAME == "MOBNAME"
its not really hard. :P Hope you enjoy and MUCH more stuff to be released!

use the if function. Modules>TalkingNPC>Init.lua
Look for ChaSay(target,character,

Before that add

if(target ~= nil and name == "npc or mob name" and Rand(100) < 5 ) then
ChaSay(target,character, "Welcome " ..playername.. " ! I hope you enjoy our Server!" )
end
